### **Electric Vehicle Data Analysis**  

#### **Project Overview**  
- Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** to analyze electric vehicle (EV) data.  
- Provides insights into **EV adoption, trends, and characteristics** across states, manufacturers, and model years.<a href=" ">View Dashboard </a>

#### **Project Focus**  
- **Analyze total EV distribution** by state.  
- **Track EV adoption trends** over time.  
- **Compare EV models & manufacturers** in the market.  
- **Assess Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility**.  
- **Differentiate Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) vs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**.  

#### **Key Questions Addressed**  
- Which states have the highest number of electric vehicles?  
- How has EV adoption evolved over the years?  
- Which manufacturers and models dominate the EV market?  
- What percentage of EVs qualify under the **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) program**?  
- How do **BEVs compare to PHEVs** in adoption rates?  

#### **Datasets Used**  
- **EV Dataset** – Includes details on **registrations, model years, manufacturers, and fuel eligibility**.  
- **CAFV Eligibility Dataset** – Determines **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) qualification**.  
- **Geographical Data** – Links **EV registrations to states** for mapping and regional analysis.  

#### **Dashboard Creation Process**  

##### **1. Data Connection & Preparation**  
- Imported **multiple datasets** and established **correct field relationships**.  
- Assigned **geographic roles** to state fields for mapping visualizations.  

##### **2. Dynamic Metric Selection**  
- **Created parameters** to toggle between **BEVs and PHEVs**.  
- **Developed calculated fields** for **total vehicles, electric range, and eligibility ratios**.  

##### **3. Visualizations**  
- **State-wise EV Distribution (Choropleth Map)**  
  - Displays **registered EVs per state** using color intensity.  
  - Includes **interactive tooltips** for exact vehicle counts.  
- **Total Vehicles by Model Year (Line Chart)**  
  - Shows **EV adoption trends from 2012 to 2024**.  
  - Includes **average values** and **annotations for peaks**.  
- **Top 10 EV Manufacturers (Bar Chart)**  
  - Highlights **top EV manufacturers** (Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW, etc.).  
- **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility (Donut Chart)**  
  - Breaks down EVs into **CAFV Eligible, Not Eligible, and Unknown** categories.  
- **Total Vehicles by Model (Heatmap Table)**  
  - Ranks **popular EV models** (Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt).  
  - Uses **color gradients** to indicate market share.  

##### **4. Filters & Interactivity**  
- **Filters Implemented:**  
  - **State Filter** – Select specific states for analysis.  
  - **EV Type Filter** – Compare BEVs and PHEVs.  
  - **CAFV Eligibility Filter** – Assess fuel program eligibility.  
  - **Model Year Filter** – Analyze adoption trends over time.  
- **Interactive Features:**  
  - Clicking on states, manufacturers, or models updates **other charts dynamically**.  

##### **5. Dashboard Assembly & Formatting**  
- **Floating Layout** – Ensures flexible spacing and alignment.  
- **Header Section** – Displays **key metrics like total vehicles and electric range**.  
- **Consistent Theme** – Used **shades of blue** for clarity and readability.  
- **Final Touches:**  
  - **Refined Tooltips** – Provides **concise insights** on hover.  
  - **Standardized Fonts** – Ensures uniformity across visual elements.  
  - **Published on Tableau Public** – Allows sharing and portfolio display.  

#### **Insights & Findings**  
- **EV Adoption by State:**  
  - Some states lead in **EV adoption**, while others show **slower growth**.  
- **Trends in Model Years:**  
  - **EV registrations surged post-2020** with increasing adoption rates.  
- **Top EV Models & Manufacturers:**  
  - **Tesla dominates**, with **Model Y and Model 3** leading in registrations.  
- **CAFV Eligibility Analysis:**  
  - A **significant percentage** of EVs qualify under the **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) program**.  

#### **Final Thoughts**  
- **Project Value:**  
  - Demonstrates expertise in **Tableau dashboard creation, data analysis, and visualization**.  
- **Learning Outcomes:**  
  - Strengthened skills in **data visualization, parameter creation, and calculated fields**.  
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Further **data segmentation and trend analysis** for refined insights.  
- **Portfolio Impact:**  
  - Showcases ability to create **interactive, data-driven dashboards** for real-world applications.
