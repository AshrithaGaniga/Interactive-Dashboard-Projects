# **Excel Project Overview**  

## **What Iâ€™m Doing:**  
Creating an interactive **Excel dashboard** to analyze a dataset of bike buyers. [View Dashboard]  

## **Project Objective:**  
Cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing **customer data** to provide insights on purchase behavior, **income levels, commute distance, education level, and age group**.  

## **Questions I'm Trying to Solve:**  
- Does **income** correlate with the likelihood of purchasing a bike?  
- How does **commute distance** affect buying decisions?  
- What are the trends in different **age groups** for bike purchases?  
- How does **education level** impact bike purchase decisions?  

## **Dataset**  

### **Columns Used:**  
- **ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Home Ownership, Cars Owned, Commute Distance, Region, Age, Purchased Bike.**  

## **Features & Analysis**  

### **Data Cleaning:**  
- Removed **duplicates** and fixed common **data entry errors**.  

### **Pivot Tables:**  
- Summarized **age groups, income levels, education levels, and bike purchase rates**.  

### **Age Grouping:**  
- Categorized customers into groups like **'Adolescent' (0-30), 'Middle Aged' (31-54), 'Old' (55+)**.  

### **Education Grouping:**  
- **Grouped education levels** as follows:  
  - **High School or Below**  
  - **Partial College**  
  - **Graduate Degree**  

## **Interactive Dashboard:**  
- Added **slicers** to filter data by **age, marital status, education level, income, and bike purchase status**.  

## **Data Visualization Focus**  

### **Initial Chart Creation:**  
- Created a **chart to represent income vs. purchase behavior**.  
- Used a **3D chart** to analyze data by **gender and education levels**.  
- Added a chart titled **'Average Income per Purchase'** for clarity.  

### **Commute Distances and Bike Purchases Visualization:**  
- Focused on **commute distances and bike purchases**.  
- Fixed an issue with **the 10-mile data** by renaming it â€˜10+ milesâ€™ for clarity.  
- Created a chart titled **'Customer Commute'** to show how commute distances affect purchase decisions.  

### **Education and Bike Purchases Visualization:**  
- Created **a bar chart** to show bike purchase trends based on **education levels**.  
- Compared **bachelorâ€™s, high school, partial college, and graduate degree holders**.  
- Observed trends indicating whether **higher education levels impact bike purchases**.  

### **Age Brackets Visualization:**  
- Grouped **age data** into 'Adolescent,' 'Middle Aged,' and 'Old' categories.  
- Created a **line chart** titled **'Customer Age Brackets'** to reveal trends.  

## **Dashboard Creation**  
- Combined **all visualizations** into a new **dashboard sheet**.  
- Adjusted **layout, colors, and size** for a clean, structured look.  
- Removed **gridlines** for a more professional presentation.  
- Finalized the dashboard to **highlight key insights**.  

## **Final Thoughts:**  
- The approach helps answer key questions, such as:  
  - Does **education level** impact bike purchases?  
  - How does **commute distance** affect buying decisions?  
- Confident that this method will be valuable for **future data projects**.  

## **How to Use:**  
 **Explore Data:** Use **filters and slicers** to interact with the dashboard and analyze different criteria.  
**Analyze:** View **key metrics** from pivot tables.  
 **Dashboard:** Explore **visualizations** in different formats (**charts, graphs, etc.**).
